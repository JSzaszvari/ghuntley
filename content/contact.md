title: contact
---

I'm usually pretty easy to get hold of, here's how I use different channels to communicate with people and how best to contact me.

# Email: <a href="mailto:ghuntley@ghuntley.com">ghuntley@ghuntley.com</a>

This is the easiest way if you want to reach out and I can usually respond pretty promptly.

# Twitter: <a href="https://twitter.com/geoffreyhuntley">geoffreyhuntley</a>

This is my primary means of broadcasting things to the world so please follow me there. I do read my DMs and allow them from people I don't follow, but would prefer email if you're reaching out from the blue about something. I don't see every mention so you may not get a reply via a public tweet.

# LinkedIn: geoffreyhuntley

My background is pretty well covered for the last couple of decades there. I accept connections from people I've met, worked with, spoken with or otherwise had enough interaction to feel that I can call them a professional contact. I don't respond to requests from people I don't know.

# Keybase and public PGP key

I'm on Keybase with both my public key available and a bunch of identity proofs as well. If you absolutely must encrypt a message, use the key there.

# What I'll definitely respond to

Genuine queries about speaking at events will get a response, even if I can't accept the invite.
What I may not respond to

I try and respond to technical queries but would prefer you try asking on Stack Overflow first.

If your message doesn't explicitly look like it needs a response or it's vague or not clear what the purpose is, you may not hear back from me.

# What I won't respond to

No, you cannot guest-post on ghuntley.com.

No, contacting me and asking "Can I ask you a question?" is already a question and won't result in me responding with "Yes, I don't know what your other question is but ask me anyway".
