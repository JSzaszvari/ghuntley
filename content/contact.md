title: contact

I'm usually pretty easy to get hold of, here's how I use different channels to communicate with people and how best to contact me.

# Email

This is the easiest way if you want to reach out and I can usually respond pretty promptly. My email address is <a href="mailto:ghuntley@ghuntley.com">ghuntley@ghuntley.com</a>

# Twitter

This is my primary means of broadcasting things to the world so please follow me there. I do read my DMs and allow them from people I don't follow. Follow <a href="http://twitter.com/geoffreyhuntley">@geoffreyhuntley</a> on Twitter.

# LinkedIn

I accept connections from anyone. I don't respond to interactions or requests from people that originate from LinkedIn unless we have met in person. If you want to catch up for coffee then organise by a medium other than LinkedIn that way I know you have atleast at minimum read this page. 

# Skype

If I'm scheduled to talk with you, find me on Skype via my email address. For anything else, please use email or Twitter, I keep Skype connections to those who really need to communicate over that channel.

# What I'll definitely respond to

Genuine queries about speaking at events will get a response, even if I can't accept the invite.

# What I may not respond to

I try and respond to technical queries but would prefer you try asking on Stack Overflow first. I do not do tech-support via email unless you have we 

If your message doesn't explicitly look like it needs a response or it's vague or not clear what the purpose is, you may not hear back from me.
