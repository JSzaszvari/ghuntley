üôå I'm Geoff, an open source maintainer. I'm responsible for authoring and maintaining tools that enable developers to deliver business value faster and easier. 

Gone are the days where a developer has to start every project by defining their own IO, data structures and subroutines. Modern developers rely on frameworks, third-party libraries and other niceties that used to take hundreds of developer person hours before writing any business logic. 

Being a maintainer, and focusing that level of effort is a labour of love, but a labour none the less. If you or your company uses open-source software or appreciates the work I do in open source, please consider [supporting me directly](/support) as it's pretty clear that software actually costs something, and that even though it may be offered freely, [somebody is paying the cost](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0t85TyH-h04). 

I currently work through a consultancy, but the opinions expressed on this site are my own and do not necessarily represent those of my clients unless otherwise stated. Do not quote me as ‚Äú$company person Geoffrey Huntley said‚Äù ‚Äì if I speak for a company, I will publish on its channels.

So far, in my career I have held the following hats: customer service, computer assembly & repair, business owner, mainframe operations, midrange system administration, bigiron field engineering, enterprise backup & recovery consulting, full-stack software developer, open-source maintainer/product owner/community leader, build automation engineer, public speaker, scrum master and servant leader for teams distributed in multiple time zones.

I live in Sydney, Australia.
