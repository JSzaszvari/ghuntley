# where?

I’m home which is Sydney, Australia. It’s Winter. I’m observing [the AEST timezone](https://time.is/Sydney).

# upcoming conferences

I recently spoke at NDC Sydney [about the importance of sustainability in open-source](https://ghuntley.com/talks/ndc-sydney-2018/). I might be speaking at the Microsoft MVP Summit on the topic of diversity. I have no further talks planned for 2019 but hey, I'm always happy to speak - just ask.

# what I'm doing now
- Haskell, Haskell, Haskell
- Doing some [live coding on a weekly basis](/live)
- Starting a weekly functional programming study group - https://sydneyhaskell.org
- Porting a linux distribution to windows subsystem for linux (nixos)
- Learning more about knitting when time permits

# what I'm considering doing
- Sketching up how we could automate closed captions for twitch broadcasters. It's annoying that a segment of society is being excluded by default. 

# what I've done so far this year
- Spoke at NDC Sydney [about the importance of sustainability in open-source](https://ghuntley.com/talks/ndc-sydney-2018/).
