# Where?

I’m home which is Sydney, Australia. It’s Winter. I’m observing the AEST timezone.

# What I'm doing now
- Reducing amount of time in the dotnet opensource ecosystem and going through motions of succession with ReactiveUI.
- Actively learning another software paradigm (Haskell) by working through the examples from [haskellbook.com](http://haskellbook.com) and helping the http://reflex-frp.org folks out with crossing the chasm. 
- Rolling my own k8 cluster from source code and passively learning golang. 
- Doing some live coding, preferably on a weekly basis
- Learning more about knitting when time permits.

# Upcoming Conferences

I'm speaking at NDC Sydney with Nick
