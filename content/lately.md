# where?

I’m home which is Sydney, Australia. It’s Winter. I’m [observing the AEST timezone](https://time.is/Sydney).

# what I'm doing now
- Porting a linux distribution to windows subsystem for linux
- Doing some [live coding on a weekly basis](/live)
- Reducing amount of time in the dotnet opensource ecosystem and [going through motions of succession](https://reactiveui.net/blog/2018/05/reactiveui-succession) with ReactiveUI.
- Actively learning another software paradigm (Haskell) by working through the examples from [haskellbook.com](http://haskellbook.com) and helping the http://reflex-frp.org folks out with crossing the chasm. 
- Rolling my own k8 cluster from source code and passively learning golang. 
- Learning more about knitting when time permits.

# upcoming conferences
