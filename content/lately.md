# what I'm doing now
- Porting a linux distribution to windows subsystem for linux
- Doing some [live coding on a weekly basis](/live)
- Reducing amount of time in the dotnet opensource ecosystem and [going through motions of succession](https://reactiveui.net/blog/2018/05/reactiveui-succession) with ReactiveUI.
- Actively learning another software paradigm (Haskell) by working through the examples from [haskellbook.com](http://haskellbook.com) and helping the http://reflex-frp.org folks out with crossing the chasm. 
- Learning more about knitting when time permits.

# what I'm considering doing
- Sketching up how we could automate closed captions for twitch broadcasters. It's annoying that a segment of society is being excluded by default. 

# what I've done so far this year
- Rolled my own k8 cluster from source code.
