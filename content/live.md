üôå I‚Äôm Geoff, an open source software engineer. I‚Äôm currently in Sydney, Australia. I‚Äôm observing [the AEST timezone](https://time.is/Sydney). Instead of writing and maintaining software on my own I'm inviting you to pair-program with me in my office. Let's build software together. Be interactive, I love live suggestions, but please be kind and constructive. Live streaming can be scary. üíñ

The stream schedule is maintained in [an online calendar you can subscribe to](https://calendar.google.com/calendar?cid=Z2h1bnRsZXkuY29tX3BjNWo0MjdjZG1sNW81MmVqczE2aG91YmMwQGdyb3VwLmNhbGVuZGFyLmdvb2dsZS5jb20). Past stream recordings are on [my YouTube channel](https://youtube.com/c/geoffreyhuntley).

I currently work through a consultancy, but the opinions expressed publicly are my own and do not necessarily represent those of my clients unless otherwise stated. Do not quote me as ‚Äú$company person Geoffrey Huntley said‚Äù ‚Äì if I speak for a company, I will publish on its channels. This is my personal slice of the internet. Everything here is me and is my opinion.

# code of conduct

Please read the [Code of Conduct](CODEOFCONDUCT.md). As a project specifically setup to encourage folks to get involved further with open-source, I do not tolerate harassment of any kind directed towards myself, family or community members.

# contributing

There's a [contributing guide](https://github.com/ghuntley/live/CONTRIBUTING.md) that outlines how you can get involved. Let's build software together. Be interactive, I love live suggestions, but please be kind and constructive. Live streaming can be scary. üíñ 

# support me

If you truly appreciate the work do on twitch or in open source, please [buy me a cup coffee](https://www.patreon.com/ghuntley).  Things that take mental energy just work better with coffee!  I (almost always) brew my own coffee unless I'm in the city in which case you'll usually find me hanging out at [Espressory](https://www.espressory.com.au/). 

Subs and Bits are also greatly appreciated. Anyway, thanks for any support you can offer if you decide to - Geoffrey Huntley

# operational safety

The 20th of December will go down as an iconic day in history. Robert E. Kelly, a political science professor at Pusan National University in South Korea, was explaining the ramifications of the impeachment of South Korea President Park Geun-hye live on the BBC in March when his two young children made their on-air debut. The clip quickly went viral and Kelly and his wife Kim Jung-A were soon [the focus of media around the world](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation-now/2017/12/20/bbc-dad-robert-kelly-thought-his-career-over-after-kids-hilariously-interrupted-live-interview/968226001/).

Kelly told the Guardian that he wasn't prepared for the spotlight the viral clip cast on his family. He said his daughter's elementary school had to hire a guard to ensure no "weirdos" showed up, and he felt uncomfortable with many peoples' assumption that his wife was his nanny. 

> "People were reading stuff into our relationship and, oh my God, I didn‚Äôt want to get near any of that crap, so we didn‚Äôt say anything", he told the Guardian. "It was a comedy of errors, a family blooper. There was nothing to say."

Whilst I live a somewhat public life, to ensure this doesn't happen I've implemented safeguards to minimise the risks of broadcasting on the internet. The line of defense is [a strip of lights](https://www.amazon.com/Philips-Ambiance-LightStrip-Compatible-Assistant/dp/B0167H33DU) attached to my door frame that act as a traffic light to let folks know if a broadcast or video call/meeting is in progress. This simple system is extremely handy for communicating availability. If you work remotely from your house as I do from time to time you should totally steal this idea - [I did](https://www.hanselman.com/blog/IsDaddyOnACallABusyLightPresenceIndicatorForLyncForMyHomeOffice.aspx). When I jump on a call or I am broadcasting the light automatically changes to red and my children understand what it means as I've had the system in place for a couple years now.

For privacy reasons and to reduce unwanted noise (typing, drinking water, swallowing, etc) I don't run my microphone "hot". Underneath my desk is a foot pedal with three buttons. When the main button is pressed it mixes the microphone into the stream and when depressed microphone input is automatically cut off.

Finally, I use a dedicated control panel so that I can switch inputs via dedicated buttons and can fade to black instantly if the need arises.
