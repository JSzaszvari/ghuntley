Figuring out how to use Twitter was one of the best things I've ever done as a software engineer as thereâ€™s a vibrant intertwined community that deeply cares. 

Twitter only gets you so far however. It's confusing to use and there's a large amount of folks (esp younger demographic) who use other mediums which is why he's started doing [live broadcasts on YouTube](/youtube) and producing short "help wanted" videos to create opportunities for folks who are just getting started with open-source but don't know where to start.

You can find all of my previous broadcasts on this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLM9jdoijSdhgssQ-KgHbKRkz80bIYHQh1">live playlist</a>.
