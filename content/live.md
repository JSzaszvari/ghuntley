üôå I‚Äôm Geoff, an open source software engineer. I‚Äôm currently in Sydney, Australia. I‚Äôm observing [the AEST timezone](https://time.is/Sydney). 

{{< tweet 1019917006479372290 >}}

Instead of writing and maintaining software on my own I'm inviting you to pair-program with me in my office. Let's build software together. Be interactive, I love live suggestions, but please be kind and constructive. Live streaming can be scary. üíñ 

The stream schedule is maintained in [an online calendar you can subscribe to](https://calendar.google.com/calendar?cid=Z2h1bnRsZXkuY29tX3BjNWo0MjdjZG1sNW81MmVqczE2aG91YmMwQGdyb3VwLmNhbGVuZGFyLmdvb2dsZS5jb20). Past stream recordings are on [my YouTube channel](https://youtube.com/c/geoffreyhuntley).

I currently work through a consultancy, but the opinions expressed publicly are my own and do not necessarily represent those of my clients unless otherwise stated. Do not quote me as ‚Äú$company person Geoffrey Huntley said‚Äù ‚Äì if I speak for a company, I will publish on its channels. This is my personal slice of the internet. Everything here is me and is my opinion.

## Code of Conduct

Please read the [Code of Conduct](CODEOFCONDUCT.md). As a project specifically setup to encourage folks to get involved further with open-source, I do not tolerate harassment of any kind directed towards myself, family or community members.

## Contributing

There's a [contributing guide](https://github.com/ghuntley/live/CONTRIBUTING.md) that outlines how you can get involved. Let's build software together. Be interactive, I love live suggestions, but please be kind and constructive. Live streaming can be scary. üíñ 

## Support me

If you truly appreciate the work do on twitch or in open source, please [buy me a cup coffee](https://www.patreon.com/ghuntley).  Things that take mental energy just work better with coffee!  I (almost always) brew my own coffee unless I'm in the city in which case you'll usually find me hanging out at [Espressory](https://www.espressory.com.au/). 

Subs and Bits are also greatly appreciated. Anyway, thanks for any support you can offer if you decide to - Geoffrey Huntley
