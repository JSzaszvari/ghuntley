Closing stale issues may seem inhospitable or offensive but the alternative is to disrespect you by setting false expectations and implicitly ignoring work. This is open-source software, created and maintained as an unpaid hobby. Automatically closing issues makes it explicit: if work is not progressing, then it's stale and should be closed because it may be already resolved.

We need more folks helping out with maintenance, not just contribution.
