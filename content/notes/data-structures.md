# Hash Table

A hash table is a data structure that maps keys to values for highly efficient lookup.

1. compute the the keys hashcode, typically a long or an int. for example a key of `"hi"` hashing to `10320` long or int.
2. map the hash code to an index in the array. an example of this would be `hash(key) % array_length`.


```
dict[key, value]
```
