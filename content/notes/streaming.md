The 20th of December will go down as an iconic day in history. Robert E. Kelly, a political science professor at Pusan National University in South Korea, was explaining the ramifications of the impeachment of South Korea President Park Geun-hye live on the BBC in March when his two young children made their on-air debut. The clip quickly went viral and Kelly and his wife Kim Jung-A were soon [the focus of media around the world](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation-now/2017/12/20/bbc-dad-robert-kelly-thought-his-career-over-after-kids-hilariously-interrupted-live-interview/968226001/).

Kelly told the Guardian that he wasn't prepared for the spotlight the viral clip cast on his family. He said his daughter's elementary school had to hire a guard to ensure no "weirdos" showed up, and he felt uncomfortable with many peoples' assumption that his wife was his nanny. 

> "People were reading stuff into our relationship and, oh my God, I didn’t want to get near any of that crap, so we didn’t say anything", he told the Guardian. "It was a comedy of errors, a family blooper. There was nothing to say."

Whilst I live a somewhat public life, to ensure this doesn't happen I've implemented safeguards to minimise the risks of broadcasting on the internet. The line of defense is [a strip of lights](https://www.amazon.com/Philips-Ambiance-LightStrip-Compatible-Assistant/dp/B0167H33DU) attached to my door frame that act as a traffic light to let folks know if a broadcast or video call/meeting is in progress.
