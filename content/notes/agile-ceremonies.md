# retrospective

# kick-off

define the scope:
- what is the goal for this sprint?
- identity any holidays, conference or other activites that will impact sprint capacity?
- filter what items to include in the sprint based on the sprint goal and the team's capacity.

plan the execution:
- apply learnings from retrospectives
- identity tasks for the backlog items and whether there are any dependencies between the items.
- maximise autonomny of stories and minimise people dependencies.
- why is the team confident that they'll be able to meet the sprint goal?

execute:
- allocate tasks based on self-selection rather than assignment by a third party.

# refinement

plan for the future:
- split features into stories, stories into tasks
- assign estimates to stories which have yet to receive one

inspect the sprint:
- is the definition of done being adhered to?
- will there be a demonstratable artifact by the end of the sprint?
- remove any user stories that no longer appear relevant
- re-assesses the relative priority of stories
- creating new user stories in response to newly discovered needs
- correct estimates in light of newly discovered information
