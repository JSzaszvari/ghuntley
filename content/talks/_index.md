Geoff has spoken at community events, large technical conferences, recorded sessions within the Microsoft CH9 studio and delivered online lectures at Xamarin University. Recent talks include programming in a reactive manner, open-source community automation and the importance of financial sustainability in open-source.

He's always thrilled to speak at conferences or user group meetings, or appear on podcasts and can speak to a variety of audiences from non-technical to deeply technical.

His next speaking engagement is with [NDC Sydney in September](https://ndcsydney.com/speaker/geoffrey-huntley/):

> The thing about OSS that's too often forgetten, it's AS-IS, no exceptions. In this talk we'll look at a day in the life of an open source maintainer - what drives them, what annoys them and what keeps them up at night
